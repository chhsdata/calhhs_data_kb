# 21. Appendix I: Scoring Scenarios for Public Health Care Coverage

This section addresses scoring scenarios involving the overlap of Insurance Coverage, Expected Payer/Public Assistance and Means-Tested Programs, and Geography. Below are three key points that summarize all the scenarios:

1. If the data is ONLY related to Residence or Service Geography, then DO NOT USE Insurance Coverage or Means-Tested Tables.
2. Means-Tested Programs—Only add interaction if enrollment in the Public Assistance program is 10 million or fewer people. No interaction is needed for Medi-Cal as the current enrollment is approximately 14 million, which exceeds 10 million.
3. If the number of members enrolled in Insurance Coverage is less than the population of the geographic subdivision, then use the Insurance Table. If the number of members enrolled in Insurance Coverage is greater than or equal to the population of the geographic subdivision, then use the Geography Table.

#### Table 36: Scoring Scenarios for Insurance Coverage and Geography Data that Includes Public Programs

In the table below, the examples assume annual data (+0 score) with under 11 events (+7 score) along with other dataset characteristics described under the Dataset Example column. A Yes entry indicates that the applicable score for that variable should be added in the Total Risk Score.

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*Base Score includes reporting time (annual), events, Expected Payer / Public Assistance or Means-Tested programs, and interaction.
