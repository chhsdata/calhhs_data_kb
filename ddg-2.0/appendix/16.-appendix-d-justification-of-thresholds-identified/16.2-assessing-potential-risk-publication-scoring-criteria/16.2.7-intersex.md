# 16.2.7 Intersex

AB 1163 (Chapter 832, Statutes of 2023) added the requirement to collect intersex status in Government Code 8310.8 when collecting “ancestry or ethnic origins of Californians.” There are no California estimates of the intersex population, but the national estimate is 1.7% of the total population. That would be a population of \~595K in California, which would be a +2 risk score as per the risk score table. The question can be asked as part of the Sex question or as its own question.
