# 13. Appendix A: Legal Framework

The overarching legal framework for the CalHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines (DDG) is the California Information Practices Act, California Civil Code 1798 et seq., which was established in 1977 and applies to all state government entities. The IPA includes requirements for the collection, maintenance, and dissemination of any information that identifies or describes an individual. The IPA and other California statutes limit the disclosure of personal information, consistent with the California Constitutional right to privacy. However, state agencies are generally permitted (and sometimes required under the California Public Records Act and other laws) to disclose data that have been de-identified. Summarized or aggregated data may still be identifiable; the DDG provides Guidelines for assessing whether data have been de-identified.

While most state agencies are covered by the IPA, some are also covered by or impacted by HIPAA. Unlike the IPA, which applies to all personal information, HIPAA only applies to certain health or health care-related information. HIPAA requirements apply in combination with IPA requirements. While the IPA does not include specific de-identification methods or criteria, the basic concept of statistical de-identification has no different meaning, and the basic standard of protection of identifiable data is no different for IPA covered PI than for HIPAA covered PHI.

“Personal Information” is defined by the California Civil Code section 1798.3(a) as “any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to:

* his or her name,
* social security number,
* physical description,
* home address,
* home telephone number,
* education,
* financial matters, and
* medical or employment history.

It includes statements made by, or attributed to, the individual.”

Under Section 1798.24 of the IPA, “An agency shall not disclose any personal information in a manner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains,” unless it is disclosed as described in Section 1798.24.

Senate Bill 13 updated the IPA, effective January 1, 2006, to require Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) review and approval before personal information (linkable to any individual) that is held by any state agency or department can be released for research purposes. CPHS does not delegate reviews for compliance with the IPA to other institutional review boards.
