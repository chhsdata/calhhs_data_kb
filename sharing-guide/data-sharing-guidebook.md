# Data Sharing Guidebook

## Introducing the CalHHS Data-Sharing Guidebook

Data is a core facilitator for the California Health and Human Services (CalHHS) vision of:

> “… a connected network of state, local, and community providers, an ecosystem of coordinated services, and the secure, appropriate use of comprehensive demographic, socioeconomic, encounter, and outcomes data to generate insights that drive equitable policies, programs, and service delivery.” – [CalHHS IT & Data Strategic Plan, March 2024](https://osi.ca.gov/CalHHS%20IT%20and%20Data%20Strat%20Plan-March-2024-Web508-v4.pdf)

&#x20;With over 33,000 employees, we at CHHS make up the largest agency under California’s executive branch. Our 13 departments collectively have access to an unprecedented amount of data -- it is our mission to use this data to improve the programs and services we deliver to our clients, amplify the impact of the data reports we create, and to create an organizational culture that is focused on data-driven decision making.

Realizing this vision requires data flow across the Agency’s departments and partner organizations. The CalHHS Data-Sharing Guidebook’s purpose is to be an asset that is broadly applicable to departments with various levels of data-sharing capabilities and experience. The diagram below provides the CalHHS Data-Sharing Guidebook’s purpose in California’s data- sharing ecosystem.

The Guide is composed of two sections:

* The Business Use Case Proposal Lessons Learned summarizes the learnings from data-sharing experts who participated in the discovery sessions used to create this Guide.
* The Data-Sharing Plays provide how-to guidance to implement capabilities that help establish data-sharing agreements and deliver meaningful data.

The Guide is a supplement to existing data-sharing assets, including:

* State of California [Interagency Data Exchange Agreement (IDEA) Guidebook](https://docs.data.ca.gov/interagency-data-exchange-idea-guidebook)
* The CalHHS [Data Playbook](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/)
* Department-level data-sharing assets

The Guidebook is shared with you and your Department so you can use its content to supplement existing department data-sharing processes and training materials.

The Guidebook’s primary audience is data coordinators and data management teams that create data-sharing agreements, fulfill data requests, and consume shared data. The Guidebook’s Data-Sharing Plays also benefit your department’s data analyst, application development and security teams.
