# Play 1: Sharing Metrics

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Roadmap Step 1 Image</p></figcaption></figure>

## Play 1: Establish Data-Sharing Metrics and BUCP Tracking

If not already in place, we recommend creating a centralized department-level repository of BUCPs and mechanisms to track data-sharing metrics. Your previous BUCPs are valuable assets. Create a centralized department-level document repository for your BUCP artifacts to:

* Establish a library of reusable BUCP content to reduce content creation time.
* Maintain templates such as standard security controls and forms required by your department.
* Store reference material such as resolutions to disputes and solutions to statutory restrictions for data-sharing.
* Store quantitative and qualitative information on data-sharing outcomes to include in business cases to invest in data-sharing.

A departmental-level view of all BUCPs also helps prioritize the data-sharing improvement efforts by identifying frequently requested datasets.

Your BUCP document repository can also be a resource for lessons learned as BUCPs are approved and fulfilled. Collect team input to create “lessons learned” that you gleaned from working through the BUCP process. Retrospectives are an effective way to engage your team to collect and document lessons learned. Feel free to use the CalHHS Data-Sharing Guide: Lessons Learned section as a starting point for your department’s lessons learned.

Make sure your data-sharing team is aware of your department’s lessons learned as they develop. You can also review the lessons learned during BUCP kickoff efforts or as challenges arise during approval and data fulfillment. Other departments can benefit from your experience as well to apply or tweak them for their purposes. Please share them with other departments through CalHHS data-focused subcommittees and workgroups.

### Identify BUCP-Related Metrics to Track <a href="#identify_bucp-related_metrics_to_track" id="identify_bucp-related_metrics_to_track"></a>

We recommend conducting a discovery session with your data-sharing team and relevant stakeholders to identify the BUCP-related metrics for tracking and reporting. Some examples of data points you may want to include in your BUCP tracking process are provided in the table below:

|               Item               |                                                                                                                               Use(s)                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     BUCP Fulfillment Duration    | <ul><li>Identify the impact of data-sharing and process improvements.</li><li>Quantitatively demonstrate the impact of data- sharing investments.</li><li>Provide metrics for staff planning.</li><li>Identify BUCP process points that impede progress.</li></ul> |
|  BUCP Outcome (Approval, Denial) |                                               <ul><li>Identify needed investments to improve BUCP approval probability.</li><li>Provide a source of “lessons learned” to optimize the data-sharing process.</li></ul>                                              |
|     Disputes and Resolutions     |                                                                                        <ul><li>Use to create metrics on the frequency of disputes and resolutions.</li></ul>                                                                                       |
|  Statutory Restriction Solutions |                                                           <ul><li>Provide a repository to identify approaches (e.g., Data Aggregation, De-Identification) to resolve data-sharing restrictions.</li></ul>                                                          |
| Data-Sharing Outcome and Results |                                                           <ul><li>Track the outcome and results of data-sharing to secure management support for investment in related capabilities and staff.</li></ul>                                                           |

Once you have your metrics and data points identified, create a mechanism to collect them in your data-sharing tracking system.

### Selecting BUCP Tracking Tools <a href="#selecting_bucp_tracking_tools" id="selecting_bucp_tracking_tools"></a>

You should check with your department’s technology and enterprise architecture teams to identify platforms for your BUCP tracking system. Also, consult with your department’s information security team to identify any required security controls for your BUCP repository. Your selected platform for BUCP tracking should include the following capabilities:

* Document repository to store BUCP’s and related documents.
* Capabilities to identify and retrieve BUCPs and other documents.
* Mechanism to track BUCP status and metrics.
* Task tracking to coordinate BUCP fulfillment activities.
* Access control to limit access to sensitive information (Specialized Security) to specific staff.

Make sure your BUCP document repository is secured with access control to safeguard sensitive information including the contents of the Specialized Security and Specialized Privacy BUCP field content.

The State of California’s Office 365 (O365) provides tools to create a BUCP tracking mechanism using Excel and Microsoft Teams.
