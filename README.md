# Data Knowledge Base

## About the Knowledge Base

The CalHHS Data Knowledge Base is composed of three main parts. These have historically been siloed documents, however, have now been published together to serve as a point of truth guide for all CalHHS data sharing needs.

## Governance and Updates

As a product, the Knowledge Base is maintained by the Center for Data Insights and Innovation. It will be reviewed at least annually to ensure base functionality, such as no broken links, etc. For questions or contribution suggestions, please email cdii@chhs.ca.gov. Each section or component of the knowledge base will have it's own governance, update cycle, and contact information. Please see below.

{% tab title="Data Sharing Guide" %}
### CalHHS Data Sharing Guidelines

The Data Sharing Guide was created in 2024 by the CalHHS Office of Technical Systems Integration (OTSI). The content of the previously published CalHHS Data Playbook and Data Playbook-Beta has been merged with this new sharing guide. If you have questions or ideas to contribute to the Data Sharing Guidebook section, please email [cdii@chhs.ca.gov](mailto:cdii@chhs.ca.gov).

{% tab title="Data De-Identification Guidelines" %}
### CalHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines

The Data De-Identification Guide published here is the current approved CalHHS Agency De-Identification Guidelines. Each Department or Office within CalHHS can also publish their own version of the DDG. The refresh cycle of the Agency DDG is determined by the CalHHS DDG Peer Review Team (PRT.) As of January 2025, the PRT is currently developing an update to the Agency DDG with publication date TBD.

* If you have questions about the governance around the Agency Data De-Identification Guidelines please visit the [DDG Governance page](ddg/8.-ddg-governance.md).
* If you need Department specific Data De-Identification Guidelines, or other Department specific data information, please contact that Department directly. This page on the CHHS website has links to each of the [CalHHS Department and Office webpages](https://www.chhs.ca.gov/about/departments-and-offices/).

{% tab title="Open Data Handbook" %}
### CalHHS Open Data Handbook

The Open Data handbook is a resource with its audience being the CalHHS ODP+GIS Workgroup and those that publish or utilize the CalHHS Open Data Portal. As of February 2025, revisions are being made to the ODP handbook. Please see the [ODP Governance page](odp/governance.md) for more information. If you have questions or ideas to contribute to the Open Data section, email [opendata@chhs.ca.gov](mailto:opendata@chhs.ca.gov).
